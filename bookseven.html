        Harry is about to turn seventeen and will lose his deceased mother's magical protection. Order of the Phoenix members relocate the Dursleys for their protection. Harry is being flown to The Burrow, with friends and allies acting as identical decoys. Death Eaters immediately attack, and, in the ensuing battle, "Mad-Eye" Moody and Hedwig are killed while George Weasley is wounded. Voldemort arrives to kill Harry, whose wand fends off the attack.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione prepare to hunt down Voldemort's four remaining Horcruxes. Each is bequeathed an object from Dumbledore: a Golden Snitch for Harry, a Deluminator for Ron, and The Tales of Beedle the Bard, for Hermione. Harry is also bequeathed the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, but the Ministry claims it never belonged to Dumbledore. Death Eaters attack during Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding reception while the Ministry of Magic falls to Voldemort. The trio flee to 12 Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black's family home that was left to Harry.
They discover that Sirius's late brother, Regulus, was the mysterious R.A.B. who stole the Horcrux locket but died in the process. His house-elf Kreacher was unable to destroy the locket, which was later stolen by Mundungus Fletcher. Kreacher locates Fletcher, who says the locket was taken by Ministry official Dolores Umbridge. Infiltrating the Ministry, the trio steal the locket from Umbridge, but Grimmauld Place is compromised in their escape. They flee to the forest and are unable to destroy the locket and have no further leads. The locket's dark nature affects Ron, who abandons the group. Harry and Hermione learn about Dumbledore's past with dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace. There they are attacked by Voldemort's snake, Nagini, who inhabited Bathilda Bagshot's corpse. They escape, but Harry's wand is badly damaged. One night, a doe Patronus guides Harry to a pond containing the Sword of Godric Gryffindor. When Harry tries to recover it, the locket tightens around his neck, nearly killing him. Ron, guided back by the Deluminator, saves him and destroys the locket Horcrux with the sword.
In Dumbledore's book, Hermione identifies a symbol also worn by Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. He tells them of the mythical Deathly Hallows: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, which can summon the dead; and an Invisibility Cloak. Xenophilius fails to say that Luna is being held captive. He summons Death Eaters to capture the trio in exchange for his daughter's freedom, but they escape. They speculate that Dumbledore won the Elder Wand by defeating Grindelwald. Harry's Invisibility Cloak is the third Hallow, and his Snitch contains the Resurrection Stone.
The trio are captured and taken to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix tortures Hermione, believing they stole Gryffindor's sword from her Gringotts vault. With help from Dobby the house-elf, they escape to Bill and Fleur's seaside cottage, along with fellow prisoners, including Luna, Mr Ollivander, and the goblin Griphook. During the escape, Bellatrix fatally wounds Dobby, and Harry hand-digs the house-elfâ€™s grave. Harry has a vision of Voldemort stealing the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. The trio break into Bellatrix's vault, believing another Horcrux is there. With Griphook's help, they break in, retrieve Hufflepuff's cup, and escape, though Griphook steals Gryffindor's sword in the process. Harry has another vision that Voldemort has been informed of the heist and decides to check his Horcruxes. Harry sees that Nagini is a Horcrux, and another is hidden at Hogwarts.
Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, helps the trio enter Hogwarts. Voldemort, alerted to Harry's whereabouts, mounts an assault on Hogwarts. The teachers and students mobilize to defend the school. Ron and Hermione destroy Hufflepuff's cup with basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets and share an impulsive kiss. Harry discovers Ravenclaw's diadem is the Horcrux hidden there. The trio find it in the Room of Requirement but Draco, Crabbe and Goyle ambush them. Crabbe attacks with fiendfyre, but is unable to control it; the cursed fire kills him and destroys the diadem. Meanwhile, many allies die during Voldemort's assault, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Fred Weasley.
The Elder Wand resists Voldemort's commands. Believing that Snape, having killed Dumbledore, is its true master, he has Nagini attack him just as Harry arrives. Mortally wounded, Snape passes his memories to Harry. Harry views them in the Pensieve. The memories reveal that Snape loved Harry's mother and acted as a double agent against Voldemort in an attempt to protect her. He watched over the trio, conjuring the doe Patronus, influenced by his love for Lily, who also had a doe Patronus. Dumbledore was dying after mishandling the ring Horcrux and planned his "murder" at Snape's hands. Harry also learns he is an unintentional Horcrux, unbeknownst to Voldemort, and must die to render Voldemort mortal. Before surrendering himself, Harry instructs Neville Longbottom to kill Nagini. On the way, he uses the Resurrection Stone to reunite with his parents and other deceased loved ones. He drops the stone as he meets Voldemort, who casts the Killing Curse on him.
Harry awakens in a dreamlike location resembling King's Cross where he is greeted by Dumbledore. Dumbledore explains that Voldemort's original Killing Curse left a soul fragment in Harry, causing their connection. The latest Killing Curse destroyed that soul fragment, allowing Harry to return to life or to "go on". Harry returns to life and feigns death. Voldemort calls for a truce at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. Neville, however, pulls Gryffindor's sword from the Sorting Hat and kills Nagini.
The battle resumes, with Molly Weasley killing Bellatrix. Harry reveals himself to Voldemort and engages him in a final battle. He explains the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not the killing of its former master. Draco, not Snape, had been the Elder Wand's master, having disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Having disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor, Harry now commands the Elder Wand. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse at Harry, but the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort. Before returning the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb, Harry uses it to repair his old wand. He keeps his Invisibility Cloak and leaves the Resurrection Stone lost in the forest.
